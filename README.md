# visualising_stocks_correlations

Using a dataset with the prices of selected stocks over time, we’ll create in this tutorial a correlation matrix that we’ll visualise with Networkx.

Full tutorial can be found [in this link]( https://medium.com/@ValeriaCortezVD/visualising-stocks-correlations-with-networkx-88f2ee25362e).

The file corr_matrix_viz.ipynb shows each function step by step. Alternatively, open the HTML file to see every step.
